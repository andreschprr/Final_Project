#the project's intention is to scrape data from Indian election 2019 for each of the 542 constituencies, and regress margin of victory in each constituency on a few different independent variables. 
# the independent variables are: dummy variable political party of winning candidate, total number of votes cast in the constituency, total number of candidates in the constituency
# there are two sets of URLs from which data has been scraped (each of these URLs keeps changing slightly to depict the different states and the constituencies within them, though the general format remains the same): 1. http://results.eci.gov.in/pc/en/trends/statewiseU011.htm; 2. http://results.eci.gov.in/pc/en/constituencywise/ConstituencywiseS033.htm
